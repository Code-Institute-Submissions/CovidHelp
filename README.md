## UX
I wanted to keep a simple and consistent design thoughout the project

### Colour Scheme 
I wanted to use a simple colour scheme which is white, black and grey(#858585)


### Mock Ups 
I used Adobe XD to design each page on 3 different screens, which are mobile, tablet and webpage. Once I was happy with the design I started designing it. Link XD templates 

Before I started designing I wanted to make sure I knew how the database at the background will work so I went through each collection I would need in the database and what information I want the user to input see attached a template of what collections I needed and what each form would need
